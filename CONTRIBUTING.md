Welcome to the **bkite** community! We're thrilled you're here to help make our Express backend starter even better. Whether it's code, bug fixes, new templates, or better docs, we welcome all contributions! Let's build something awesome together.

---

## 🌟 Getting Started

**bkite** is a **monorepo**, meaning we keep multiple projects in one repository under the `packages/` folder. Here's how to get started:

### Pick Your Project:

* **[create-bkite](https://github.com/sreegopalsaha/bkite/tree/main/packages/create-bkite)**: The main CLI tool (`npm create bkite@latest`) lives here. This is the core of bkite right now, where you can improve the CLI that scaffolds Express apps! 🎉  

* **[bkite-core](https://github.com/sreegopalsaha/bkite/tree/main/packages/bkite-core)**: This folder is for future reusable components or shared logic. It's early days, but we're open to your ideas.

### Fork and Clone:

1.  **Fork the repo**: Go to `https://github.com/sreegopalsaha/bkite` and click the "Fork" button to create your own copy of the repo.
2.  **Clone your forked repo**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/bkite.git
    cd bkite
    ```
3.  **Navigate to the project you want to work on**. For example, for the `create-bkite`:
    ```bash
    cd packages/create-bkite
    ```
4.  **Install dependencies**:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

## 🛠️ How to Contribute

We're open to all contributions — code, bug fixes, new templates (like TypeScript or database support), documentation, or cool CLI ideas! Here's the process:

---

## 📦 Project Structure

The project follows a monorepo layout:

```
packages/
├── create-bkite/      # The main CLI tool
└── bkite-core/        # Shared logic and future internals (WIP)
```

Inside `packages/create-bkite/`, you'll find:

```
create-bkite/
├── bin/               # CLI entry point
├── templates/         # All backend template folders (your main area)
└── utils/             # Template scanning and utility functions
```

> You will mostly be working inside `packages/create-bkite/`.

---

## 🚀 Try Before You Contribute

Before contributing, **use the CLI yourself** to understand how it works:

```bash
npm create bkite@latest
```

This helps you grasp how the interactive selection works and what the output structure looks like. The CLI will now guide you through:

1. **Language selection** (JavaScript/TypeScript)
2. **Database selection** (PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB, or None)
3. **ORM/ODM selection** (Prisma, Drizzle, Mongoose)

---

## 🧠 How the Template System Works

Each backend stack combination has its own folder inside:

[packages/create-bkite/templates](https://github.com/sreegopalsaha/bkite/tree/main/packages/create-bkite/templates)

We follow this naming convention:

`<database>-<orm>-<language>`

All lowercase and hyphen-separated.

**🎉 Dynamic Template Discovery**

The CLI **automatically scans** the `templates/` folder and shows users only the combinations that actually exist. When you add a new template folder, it will automatically appear in the interactive selection menu — no need to manually update CLI logic!

---

## 📂 Templates You Can Help Build

Below is a list of required folder combinations. You can contribute one or more of them — just make sure each PR is atomic (one template = one PR).

### ✅ Core Logic (No Database)

* `core-js/` — already exists  
* `core-ts/` — already exists 

### ✅ PostgreSQL

* `postgres-prisma-js/`
* `postgres-prisma-ts/`
* `postgres-drizzle-js/`
* `postgres-drizzle-ts/`

### ✅ MySQL

* `mysql-prisma-js/`
* `mysql-prisma-ts/`
* `mysql-drizzle-js/`
* `mysql-drizzle-ts/`

### ✅ MongoDB

- `mongodb-mongoose-js/` — already exists  
- `mongodb-mongoose-ts/`  
- `mongodb-prisma-js/`  
- `mongodb-prisma-ts/`  

**Example:** If you're building a TypeScript backend using MongoDB and Mongoose, your folder should be: `mongodb-mongoose-ts/`

---

## 📐 Contribution Guidelines

> ✅ **Adding a template will automatically make it show up in the CLI!**

When users run `npm create bkite@latest`, your new template will automatically appear in the interactive selection menu. The CLI dynamically scans the `templates/` folder and presents all available combinations.

**Just add your template folder with the correct naming convention, and you're done!**

---

### 🔁 Use Existing Templates as Reference

Start by looking at existing templates:

- `templates/core-js/`
- `templates/mongodb-mongoose-js/`

🔒 **Do not** change the folder structure, file names, or base logic unnecessarily.  
🛠️ Only update the parts relevant to your tech stack (e.g., dependencies, DB config, code in `src/`).

---

### 📦 `package.json` Format

Use the following structure for your `package.json`:

```json
{
  "name": "placeholder",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "type": "module",
  "main": "index.js",
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "nodemon -r dotenv/config --experimental-json-modules src/index.js"
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "cors": "^2.8.5",
    "dotenv": "^16.0.3",
    "express": "^4.18.2"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "nodemon": "^3.1.7"
  }
}
```

---

## 🔄 Contribution Workflow

1.  **Fork & Clone**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/bkite.git
    cd bkite/packages/create-bkite
    npm install
    ```

2.  **Create a Branch**

    ```bash
    git checkout -b add/mysql-prisma-ts
    ```

3.  **Add Your Template Folder**
    Add your folder under `templates/`, using the correct naming convention.
    The CLI will automatically detect and include your template!

4.  **Test Your Template**
    
    ```bash
    # you can test the CLI directly using
    node bin/index.js
    ```
    
    Make sure your template appears in the interactive selection and creates a working project.

5.  **Push & Open a Pull Request**

    ```bash
    git push origin add/mysql-prisma-ts
    ```

    Then open a pull request against the `main` branch.

    Link the issue number (e.g., "Closes #42") and clearly describe your changes.

---

## 🧹 Code Practices

* Keep code minimal and idiomatic
* Match formatting of `core-js`/`core-ts`
* Clear commit messages:
    * `Add mysql-drizzle-ts template`
    * `Fix MongoDB connection error in template`
* Avoid adding new dependencies unless necessary for your stack
* Test your template through the interactive CLI before submitting
