# Express + Bkite (Typescript)

This backend structure is generated by [bkite](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-bkite) â€” a tool that gives you a minimal and clean Express.js setup in seconds.

Includes:

* File & folder structure auto-generated in **seconds**
* Routes, controllers, middlewares, utils, and config
* Built-in CORS support
* Centralized error handling, API response & error format
* `.env` support out of the box

## âœ¨ Why Use This?

Bkite saves your time by giving you a pre-structured Express backend â€” you don't need to manually create routes, setup error handling, or manage file structures. Just run and build.

## ðŸš€ Usage

Run this in your terminal:

```
npm create bkite@latest .
```

Then:

```
npm install
npm run dev
```

Your backend is ready.

By default, the server will run on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) after running the `dev` command.

No boilerplate. No setup pain. Just clean structure and instant productivity.
